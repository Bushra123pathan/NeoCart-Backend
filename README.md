#  NeoCart - E-commerce Backend

**NeoCart** is a Django REST Framework-based backend solution for an e-commerce platform.  
It provides secure user authentication, product management, cart functionality, and order processing, all with role-based access.

---

## Functional Features

### 1. User Management

- User registration and login using **JWT authentication**
- **Three user roles**:
  - **Admin** â€“ Manage all users, products, and orders
  - **Seller** â€“ Add, update, and manage their own products, view orders related to their products
  - **Customer** â€“ Browse products, manage cart, place orders
- Role-based access control across all endpoints
- API to view and update user profile

---

### 2. Product Management

- CRUD operations by **seller** or **admin**
- Product fields: `title`, `description`, `price`, `stock`, `category`, `image_url`
- Product listing with:
  -  Search by name
  -  Filter by category and price range
  -  Sorting (ordering by price or other fields)
  -  Pagination support
- Product detail API

---

### 3.  Cart Management

- Customers can:
  - Add products to cart
  - Update quantity
  - Remove items
- Only one active cart per customer
- Auto-calculation of total cart value

---

### 4.  Order Management

- Customers can place orders directly from their cart
- Order includes:
  - Unique order ID
  - Total price
  - List of ordered items
  - Order status and timestamp
- Order status lifecycle: `Placed â†’ Shipped â†’ Delivered`
- Sellers can view orders related to their products
- Admins can view and manage all orders

---

### 5.  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- APIs protected using **custom permissions**
- Only authorized roles can perform specific actions  
  (e.g., only sellers can add products, only customers can place orders)
